This is the list of articles that I have read. Most of the articles are tech-related topic. There are some great lists which we could found from [Dan Luu](https://github.com/danluu). His collection of *post-mortems* and *debuggin-stories* are great.

**Debug**
- [The story of one latency spike](https://http2.cloudflare.com/the-story-of-one-latency-spike/) CloudFlare team has shared a great story of how they debugged and found the latency inside Linux kernel.
- [A millisecond isn't fast](http://jvns.ca/blog/2015/09/10/a-millisecond-isnt-fast-and-how-we-fixed-it/) Julia Evans wrote an article to summarize her experience to make one function in Scala 100x faster.

**Courses and Challenges**: Some links that could help us build our CS skills.
- [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](https://cs231n.github.io/) This course is from Stanford. It provides us a general view of machine learning as well as deep learning. If you have or have not had any experience with machine learning, it is still worth a try. The notes are so well written and intuitive.
- [SEED lab](http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/) It provides us a bundle of hand-on exercises to understand computer security.
- [Over the wire](http://overthewire.org/wargames/): A lot of challenges in security area.
- [Reverse Engineer Challenge](http://challenges.re/): Its title tells all.
- [Stockfighter](https://www.stockfighter.io/) Capture the flag challenge

**Jobs**: Some links to find jobs
